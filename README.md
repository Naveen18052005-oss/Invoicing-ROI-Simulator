# Invoicing-ROI-Simulator
The Invoicing ROI Simulator is a full-stack web application designed to help businesses quickly estimate the return on investment (ROI) and cost savings achieved by automating their invoicing processes.


#Planned Approach:

Frontend Development (React):

*Build an intuitive form for inputting key business metrics.
*Display instant ROI and savings results dynamically.
*Include options to save or load scenarios and trigger PDF downloads.

#Backend Development (Node + Express):

*Create RESTful APIs for simulation, scenario management, and report generation.
*Implement internal constants (hidden from the frontend) to calculate automation savings.
*Ensure all outputs favor automation using bias logic.

#Database Integration (MongoDB):

*Store scenario inputs and computed results for retrieval and deletion.
*Use Mongoose models for structured schema management.

#Report Generation:

*Generate a downloadable ROI report in PDF format after user email submission.
*Include all calculated metrics in a well-formatted PDF layout.

#Deployment:

*Host backend using Render
*Deploy frontend using Vercel for public demo access.



#High-Level Architecture:

Frontend (React)  <-->  Backend (Express API)  <-->  Database (MongoDB)
       │                       │                         │
   ROI Form UI         ROI Calculation Logic         Scenario Storage
   Results Display      PDF Generation Endpoint       CRUD Operations

#Technologies, Frameworks, and Database

*Frontend Framework: React.js
*Styling Framework: Tailwind CSS
*Backend Framework: Node.js + Express.js
*Database: MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
*Runtime Environment: Node.js
*Deployment Options: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)




#Key Features and Functionality:

*Quick Simulation:
Instantly compute cost savings, payback period, and ROI from basic business inputs.

*Scenario Management (CRUD):
Save, retrieve, and delete simulation scenarios using a database.

*Favorable ROI Logic:
Internal bias factors ensure automation always shows a measurable advantage.

*Report Generation (Email-Gated):
Download ROI reports in PDF format after submitting an email address.

*Server-Side Constants:
Sensitive parameters (e.g., automation cost, error rates) are hidden and computed securely on the backend.

*RESTful API Design:
Clear endpoints for simulation, scenario storage, retrieval, and PDF generation.
